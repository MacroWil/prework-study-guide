# <Pre-work study guide>

## Description

This is a simple project that I plan to use to store notes over the course of my upcoming coding bootcamp. It will serve as a place to store my notes, and will help me reaffirm old information as I enter my notes. Through creating this small "website", I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and GIT.
